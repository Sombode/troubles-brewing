# Trouble's Brewing

Trouble's Brewing is a small game developed as the end-of-year project for a high school CS1 class. The game was built entirely in Visual Studio, running off of Visual Basic.

In the game, you play as an amateur alchemist selling potions, brewing concoctions to match customer specifications for profit. A more detailed, [visual guide can be found below](#gameplay-guide).
